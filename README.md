# SpringbootCRUD
Welcome to the Spring CRUD Application with API repository! This project is designed to demonstrate a simple yet robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Spring Boot. The application exposes a RESTful API to manage a basic entity, providing endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete records.
